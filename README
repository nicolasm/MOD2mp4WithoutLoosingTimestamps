MOD to mp4 without loosing timestamps
-------------------------------------

If you have a camcorder like the JVC GZ-MS90 movies are recorded as .MOD files. If you
want to make something out of them you will need to convert them to .mp4 or another format
by using MPEG Streamclip.

The problem is that by doing so you are loosing creation and modification dates.

The script will get the creation and modification dates from the .MOD files and apply them
to the .mp4 files in the same folder. It assumes that you have installed the developer
tools as the GetFileInfo and SetFile are called to get and set creation/modification dates
on files. A Growl notification will appear for each successfully updated file.
